# Introduction

<img src="https://github.com/palaeoverse-community/palaeoverse/raw/main/man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="120" />

`palaeoverse` is an R package developed by palaeobiologists, for palaeobiologists. The aim of the package is to generate a community-driven toolkit of generic functions for the palaeobiological community. The package does not provide implementations of statistical analyses, rather it provides auxiliary functions to help streamline analyses and improve code readability and reproducibility. This vignette (or tutorial if you prefer) is provided to guide you through the installation process and some of the functionality available within `palaeoverse`. To do so, we will focus on a usage example looking at latitudinal trends in Phanerozoic reefs.

## Installation

The `palaeoverse` package can be installed via CRAN or its dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/palaeoverse-community/palaeoverse) if the development version is preferred. To install via the CRAN, simply use: 

```{r echo = TRUE}
install.packages("palaeoverse")
```

To install the development version, first install the `devtools` package, and then use `install_github` to install `palaeoverse` directly from GitHub. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("palaeoverse-community/palaeoverse")
```

You can now load `palaeoverse` using the default `library` function:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(palaeoverse)
```

**Before we get onto the good stuff, the development team has a small request**. If you use `palaeoverse` in your research, please cite the associated publication. This will help us to continue our work in supporting you to do yours. You can access the appropriate citation via:

```{r echo = TRUE}
citation("palaeoverse")
```

# Using the package

Functions in `palaeoverse` are designed around the assumption that most users' data are stored in an occurrence `data.frame`. As such, this is the expected input data format for most functions. We provide two example occurrence datasets (`tetrapods` and `reefs`) within the package from different data sources. While these two datasets have similar structures, the data (variables) available in each differ. The `tetrapods` dataset is a compilation of Carboniferous--Early Triassic tetrapod occurrences (*n* = 5,270) from the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/#). The `reefs` dataset is a compilation of Phanerozoic reef occurrences (*n* = 4,363) from the [PaleoReefs Database](https://www.paleo-reefs.pal.uni-erlangen.de). In this vignette, we shall use both datasets to demonstrate available functionality in `palaeoverse`.

```{r echo = TRUE}
# Call the datasets:
data(tetrapods)
data(reefs)

# Vew the first five lines of each:
head(tetrapods)
head(reefs)
```

*Note that while both datasets contain a unique occurrence on each row, and unique variables in each column, the variables vary between the two.*

# Exploring the functions

### 1. Filter occurrences to unique taxa

In many cases palaeobiologists count unique taxa by retaining only unique occurrences identified to a given taxonomic resolution (e.g. genera or species), however this can result in some useful information being discarded. The `tax_unique` function retains occurrences identified to a coarser taxonomic resolution which are not already represented within the dataset. Take, for example, the following occurrences:

- *Albertosaurus sarcophagus*
- *Ankylosaurus* sp.
- *Ceratopsidae* indet.
- *Ornithominus* sp.
- *Tyrannosaurus rex* 

A filter for species-level identifications would reduce the species richness to just two (*A. sarcophagus* and *T. rex*). However, none of these clades are nested within one another, so each of the indeterminately identified occurrences represents at least one species not already represented in the dataset. `tax_unique` is designed to deal with such taxonomic data and would retain all seven 'species' in this example. For further details see `?tax_unique`.

This function can be especially useful for when looking at alpha diversity (local richness). Let's apply it to the `tetrapods` dataset by filtering it to genus-level. 

```{r}
# filter to genus-level:
tet_genera <- tax_unique(occdf = tetrapods, genus = "genus", family = "family",
                         order = "order", class = "class", resolution = "genus")
```

To see how the function has performed, take a look at row 1008, which records an indeterminate occurrence of the family *Melosauridae* This occurrence now has a unique name of 'Melosauridae sp.'
```{r}
tet_genera[1008, ]

```

We can compare how the alpha genus diversity from the original dataset compares to the alpha genus diversity after `tax_unique`:
```{r}
# how many unique genera before:
length(unique(tetrapods$genus))

# how many unique genera after:
length(unique(tet_genera$unique_name))
```

Now, let's use this function to record the number of unique occurrences by collection (=locality) with `group_apply`: 
```{r}
coll_genera <- group_apply(occdf = tetrapods,
                           group = c("collection_no"),
                           fun = tax_unique,
                           genus = "genus",
                           family = "family",
                           order = "order",
                           class = "class",
                           resolution = "genus")

# see structure of the new dataframe:
str(coll_genera)
```

Next, let's count the number of unique taxa per collection (=locality):
```{r}
coll_taxa <- aggregate(coll_genera$unique_name, by=list(coll_genera$collection_no), FUN=length)

# rename column names:
colnames(coll_taxa) <- c("collection_no","n_taxa")

# take a look at the new dataframe
head(coll_taxa)
```

To plot an alpha diversity (local richness) plot, we will need the ages of intervals in millions of years. Since the numeric ages may have changed since we downloaded the data from the PBDB, we'll use `look_up` to get the numeric ages for the occurrences within `tetrapods` dataset based on their assigned interval names:

```{r}
# get new numeric ages for named intervals
# the default is to use the Geological Time Scale 2020
occdf <- look_up(tetrapods)

# take the columns pertaining to collections and their ages in millions of years:
coll_info <- occdf[, c("collection_no", "interval_max_ma", "interval_mid_ma", "interval_min_ma")]

# remove duplicated collections based on the collection number (column 1)
coll_info <- coll_info[!duplicated(coll_info[1]),]

# combine this dataframe with the dataframe from above
alpha_data <- merge(coll_info, coll_taxa, by = "collection_no")

# take a look:
head(alpha_data)

```


Time to plot alpha diversity! Let's start with a simple scatterplot:

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=7.2}

plot(alpha_data$interval_mid_ma, alpha_data$n_taxa, # add the points
     xlim = rev(range(alpha_data$interval_mid_ma, na.rm = TRUE)), # reverse the x-axis
     xlab="Time (Ma)", ylab="No. taxa", # axes labels
     pch = 19, col = "#0e826f") # point style and colour

```




### 2. Adding a geological timescale to a plot axis

Sometimes, we might like to add a geological timescale to our plots. `axis_geo()` adds a geological timescale between the plot and the axis. 

Taking our plot from above, let's use this function to add a timescale to the x-axis

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=7.2}
# set margins
par(mar = c(7.1, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1)) # expand at bottom if adding more interval categories

# alpha diversity plot
plot(alpha_data$interval_mid_ma, alpha_data$n_taxa, # add the points
     axes = FALSE,
     xlim = rev(range(alpha_data$interval_mid_ma, na.rm = TRUE)), # reverse the x-axis
     xlab=" ", ylab="No. taxa", # axes labels
     pch = 19, col = "#0e826f") # point style and colour
box()
axis(2) # add a normal axis to the elft side
axis_geo(side = 1, intervals = list("epochs", "periods"))
title(xlab = "Time (Ma)", line = 4)


```

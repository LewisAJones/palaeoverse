\title{Palaeorotate fossil occurrences}
\usage{
palaeorotate(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{data.frame}. Fossil occurrences to be palaeogeographically reconstructed. \code{x} should be a dataframe containing the
following named columns: "lng", "lat", "age". Age should be supplied in millions of years before present (Ma). This format is intentionally strict to ensure
that data is entered correctly to prevent errors such as longitude and latitude being confused.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing the original occurrence dataframe, age of rotation (Ma), and
reconstructed coordinates. Age of rotation is deduced from the reference ages supplied and closest midpoint of a stratigraphic stage.
}
\description{
A function to generate stage-level palaeocoordinates (0--540 Ma) for fossil occurrence data (i.e. reconstruct the geographic distribution of organism's remains
at time of deposition). Each occurrence will be assigned palaeocoordinates based on its current geographic distribution and age estimate.
}
\details{
This function generates palaeocoordinates by spatiotemporally linking present-day geographic coordinates and age estimates with a spatial
grid (1ยบ x 1ยบ) rotated to the midpoint of stratigraphic stages (GTS, 2020; \url{https://stratigraphy.org/timescale/}). As such, palaeocoordinates can be efficiently generated for large datasets with
relatively little computational power. A further benefit of this approach is that no internet connection is required as in previously implemented API approaches.
In addition, no additional software or knowledge is required from the user (i.e. GPlates). However, it should be noted that if specific ages of rotation are required,
or fine-scale spatial analyses is being conducted, use of \url{https://www.gplates.org} might be preferable for the user.

The current palaeorotations (0--540 Ma) provided were generated using a 1ยบ x 1ยบ spatial grid with the GPlates software \url{https://www.gplates.org} and the plate rotation model
"PALEOMAP" (Scotese and Wright, 2018). A finer-scale spatial grid may be implemented in the future, along with the inclusion of more plate rotation models.

\examples{
Generic example with a few occurrences
x <- data.frame(lng = c(54, 95, 12), lat = c(86, 12, -65), age = c(45, 203, 467))
palaeorotate(x = x)

Now with some real fossil occurrence data

Grab some data from the Paleobiology Database
x <- read.csv("https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/colls/list.csv?base_name=Scleractinia&interval=Anisian,Piacenzian")

Assign midpoint age of fossil occurrence data for rotation
x$age <- (x$max_ma + x$min_ma)/2

Rotate the data
x <- palaeorotate(x = x)
}

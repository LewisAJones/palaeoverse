\usage{
palaeorotate(x, model = "Merdith2021", uncertainty = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{dataframe}. Fossil occurrences to be palaeogeographically reconstructed. \code{x} should be a dataframe containing the
following named columns: "lng", "lat", "age". Age should be supplied in millions of years before present (Ma). This format is intentionally strict to ensure
that data is entered correctly to prevent errors such as longitude and latitude being confused.}

\item{model}{\code{character}. The name of the plate rotation model to be used to reconstruct palaeocoordinates. Choose from: "Merdith2021", "Scotese2018", and "Wright2013".
The default is "Merdith2021". See details below for further information on each model.}

\item{uncertainty}{\code{logical}. Should uncertainty in palaeogeographic reconstructions be returned? If set to TRUE, the palaeocoordinates from the three plate rotation models
are returned ("Merdith2021", "Scotese2018", and "Wright2013"), along with their respective longitudinal and latitudinal range.}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} containing the original input occurrence dataframe, age of rotation (Ma), and
the reference coordinates rotated. "rot_age" refers to the age of rotation and is deduced from the reference age
provided and the closest midpoint age of a stratigraphic stage. "rot_lng" and "rot_lat" refer to the reference coordinates rotated.
"p_lng" and "p_lat" are the reconstructed coordinates for respective plate rotation models.
}
\description{
A function to generate stage-level palaeocoordinates (0--540 Ma) for fossil occurrence data (i.e. reconstruct the geographic distribution of organism's remains
at time of deposition). Each occurrence is assigned palaeocoordinates based on its current geographic distribution and age estimate.
}
\details{
This function generates palaeocoordinates by spatiotemporally linking present-day geographic coordinates and age estimates with a spatial
grid (1 x 1 degree) rotated to the midpoint of stratigraphic stages (Geological Timescale, 2020; \url{https://stratigraphy.org/timescale/}). As such, palaeocoordinates can be efficiently generated for large datasets with
relatively little computational power. In addition, no additional software or knowledge is required from the user (i.e. GPlates). However, it should be noted that if specific ages of rotation are required,
or fine-scale spatial analyses is being conducted, use of \url{https://www.gplates.org} might be preferable for the user (particularly if your occurrences are close to plate boundaries).

The current palaeorotations (0--540 Ma) provided were generated using a 1 x 1 degree spatial grid with the GPlates software \url{https://www.gplates.org} and three different plate rotation models
"Merdith2021" (Merdith et al., 2021), "Scotese2018" (Scotese & Wright, 2018), and "Wright2013" (Wright et al. 2013). A finer-scale spatial grid will be implemented in the future, along with the inclusion of more plate rotation models.

\usage{
tax_unique(
  paleobioDB = NULL,
  species = NULL,
  genus = NULL,
  family = NULL,
  order = NULL,
  class = NULL,
  resolution = "species",
  by = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{paleobioDB}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of taxonomic occurrences
downloaded directly from the Paleobiology Database. The dataframe must
include the following columns: class, order, family, genus, accepted_name.}

\item{species}{\code{character}. A vector of species names.}

\item{genus}{\code{character}. A vector of genus names.}

\item{family}{\code{character}. A vector of family names.}

\item{order}{\code{character}. A vector of order names.}

\item{class}{\code{character}. A vector of class names.}

\item{resolution}{\code{character}. The taxonomic resolution at which to
identify unique occurrences, either species (the default) or genera.}

\item{by}{\code{numeric, character}. A category within which to determine
unique taxa. When using \code{paleobioDB}, this should specify the
column within the dataframe to use as the category. When using individual
taxonomic vectors, this should be an additional vector of numbers or
character-based labels designating which category each occurrence belongs to.}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} of unique taxa, with row numbers corresponding to
the original dataset.
}
\description{
A function to filter a list of taxonomic occurrences to unique taxa of a
predefined resolution. In many cases palaeobiologists achieve this by
retaining only unique occurrences identified to the given taxonomic
resolution, however here we also retain occurrences identified to a coarser
resolution which are not already represented within the dataset.
If we take the following set of occurrences:
Albertosaurus sarcophagus
Ankylosaurus sp.
Aves indet.
Ceratopsidae indet.
Hadrosauridae indet.
Ornithominus sp.
Tyrannosaurus rex
then a filter for species-level identifications will reduce the species
diversity to two. However, none of these clades are nested within another, so
each of the indeterminately identified occurrences represents at least one
species not already represented in the dataset. This function is designed to
deal with such taxonomic data, and would retain all seven 'species' in this
dataset.
Data can be supplied in one of two forms, either a dataframe containing
standard occurrence data from the Paleobiology Database, or a series of
vectors which each describe a different taxonomic level for a set of
occurrences (the order of names in the vectors must correspond). At a
minimum, species, genus, and family vectors must be supplied. Occurrence
data can be filtered to retain either unique species or unique genera, and
can be defined as unique either across the whole dataset or within set
categories (e.g. temporal intervals, spatial bins). Missing data should be
indicated with NAs.

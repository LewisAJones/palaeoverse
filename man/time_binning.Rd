\title{Assign fossil occurrences to time bins}
\usage{
time_binning(
  occdf,
  bins,
  method = "mid",
  reps = 100,
  scale = "GTS2020",
  return_error = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of the fossil occurrences you wish
to bin. This dataframe should contain  the following named columns:
"max_ma" and "min_ma". These columns may be either \code{numeric} or \code{character}
values. Ages given in \code{numeric} form are preferred for bin assignment.
However, if interval names are provided, the function will try to match names
to the Geological Timescale 2012/2020 (depending on user specification) to
generate \code{numeric} ages for occurrences.}

\item{bins}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of the bins that you wish to allocate
fossil occurrences to. This dataframe must contain at least the following named
columns: "bin", "max_ma" and "min_ma", and must be \code{numeric} values.}

\item{method}{\code{character}. The method desired for binning fossil occurrences.
Currently, five methods exist in this function: "mid", "majority", "all", "random",
and "point". See Details for a description of each.}

\item{reps}{\code{numeric}. A non-negative \code{numeric} specifying the number of
replications for sampling. This argument is only useful in the case of the "random"
or "point" method being specified in the \code{method} argument. Defaults to 100.}

\item{scale}{\code{character}. Specify the desired geological timescale to be used
"GTS2020" or "GTS2012". This argument is only relevant if "min_ma" and "max_ma"
columns are interval names. The function will attempt to match supplied interval
names with "GTS2020" or "GTS2012" in \code{occdf} to pull numeric boundary values for
the interval. Note that the function will return an error if interval names do
not match precisely. Available interval names can be accessed via the call
GTS2020$interval_name or GTS2012$interval_name. "GTS2020" is the default option.}

\item{return_error}{\code{logical}. Should a vector of numbers be returned to flag
the rows of the \code{occdf} that cannot be matched to the interval names?}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} of the original input \code{occdf} with appended bin assignment.
If \code{method} is specified as "random" or "point", assignments are stored as a
\code{list} in the dataframe.
}
\description{
A function to assign fossil occurrences to specified time bins based on
different approaches commonly applied in palaeobiology.
}
\details{
Five approaches (methods) exist in the \code{time_binning()} function for
assigning occurrences to time bins:
\itemize{
\item Midpoint: The "mid" method is the simplest approach, and uses the midpoint of
the fossil occurrence age range to bin the occurrence.
\item Majority: The "majority" method bins an occurrence into the bin which it most overlaps with.
As part of this implementation, the majority percentage overlap of the occurrence is also calculated.
If desired, these percentages can be used to further filter an occurrence dataset.
\item All: The "all" method bins an occurrence into every bin its age ranges covers.
\item Random: The "random" method randomly samples X amount of bins (with replacement) from the bins
that the fossil occurrence age range covers.
\item Point: The "point" method randomly samples X amount of point age estimates from the
age range of the fossil occurrences. Sampling is weighted by a normal probability
distribution defined by the age range of the fossil occurrence.

\examples{
#Grab some data from the Paleobiology Database
occdf <- read.csv("https://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/colls/list.csv?base_name=Scleractinia")

#Assign via midpoint age of fossil occurrence data
time_binning(occdf = occdf, bins = bins, method = "mid")

#Assign to all bins that age range covers
time_binning(occdf = occdf, bins = bins, method = "all")

#Assign via majority overlap based on fossil occurrence age range
time_binning(occdf = occdf, bins = bins, method = "majority")

#Assign randomly to overlapping bins based on fossil occurrence age range
time_binning(occdf = occdf, bins = bins, method = "random", reps = 100)

#Assign point estimates based on fossil occurrence age range
time_binning(occdf = occdf, bins = bins, method = "point", reps = 100)

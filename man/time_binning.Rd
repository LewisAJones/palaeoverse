\usage{
time_binning(
  occdf,
  bins,
  method = "mid",
  reps = 100,
  scale = "GTS2020",
  return_error = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of the fossil occurrences you wish
to bin. This dataframe should contain  the following named columns:
"max_ma" and "min_ma". These columns may be either \code{numeric} or \code{character}
values. Ages given in \code{numeric} form are preferred for bin assignment.
However, if interval names are provided, the function will try to match names
to the Geological Timescale 2012/2020 (depending on user specification) to
generate \code{numeric} ages for occurrences.}

\item{bins}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of the bins that you wish to allocate
fossil occurrences to. This dataframe must contain at least the following named
columns: "bin", "max_ma" and "min_ma", and must be \code{numeric} values.}

\item{method}{\code{character}. The method desired for binning fossil occurrences.
Currently, five methods exist in this function: "mid", "majority", "all", "random",
and "point". See Details for a description of each.}

\item{reps}{\code{numeric}. A non-negative \code{numeric} specifying the number of
replications for sampling. This argument is only useful in the case of the "random"
or "point" method being specified in the \code{method} argument. Defaults to 100.}

\item{scale}{\code{character}. Specify the desired geological timescale to be used
"GTS2020" or "GTS2012". This argument is only relevant if "min_ma" and "max_ma"
columns are \code{character} values of interval names. Available interval names can be
accessed via the call GTS2020$interval_name or GTS2012$interval_name. "GTS2020" is
the default option.}

\item{return_error}{\code{logical}. Should a vector of numbers be returned to flag
the rows of the \code{occdf} that cannot be matched to the interval names?}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} of the original input \code{occdf} with the following appended
columns: occurrence id (\code{id}), number of bins the occurrences covers (\code{n_bins}), bin assignment
(\code{bin_assignment}), and bin midpoint (\code{bin_midpoint}). In the case of the "random" method,
a \code{list} is appended for the bin assignment and midpoint columns. If \code{method} is
specified as "point", only point age estimates are appended (\code{point_estimates}) as a
\code{list} in the dataframe.

\description{
A function to assign fossil occurrences to specified time bins based on
different approaches commonly applied in palaeobiology.
}
\details{
Five approaches (methods) exist in the \code{time_binning()} function for
assigning occurrences to time bins:
\itemize{
\item Midpoint: The "mid" method is the simplest approach, and uses the midpoint of
the fossil occurrence age range to bin the occurrence.
\item Majority: The "majority" method bins an occurrence into the bin which it most overlaps with.
As part of this implementation, the majority percentage overlap of the occurrence is also calculated
and returned as an additional column in \code{occdf}. If desired, these percentages can be used to further
filter an occurrence dataset.
\item All: The "all" method bins an occurrence into every bin its age range covers. For occurrences
with age ranges of more than one bin, the occurrence row is duplicated. Each occurrence is assigned
an ID in the column \code{occdf$id} so that duplicates can be tracked. Additionally, \code{occdf$n_bins} records
the number of bins each occurrence appears within.
\item Random: The "random" method randomly samples X amount of bins (with replacement) from the bins
that the fossil occurrence age range covers. The \code{reps} argument determines the number of
times the sample process is repeated. All replications for each occurrence are stored as a list within the
\code{occdf$bin_assignment} and \code{occdf$bin_midpoint} column.
\item Point: The "point" method randomly samples X amount of point age estimates from the
age range of the fossil occurrence. Sampling is weighted by a normal probability
distribution defined by the age range of the fossil occurrence. The \code{reps} argument determines the
number of times the sample process is repeated. All replications for each occurrence are stored as a list
within the \code{occdf$point_estimates} column.

\title{Assign fossil occurrences to spatial bins}
\usage{
bin_spatial(
  occdf,
  lng = "lng",
  lat = "lat",
  method = "grid",
  dist = 250,
  buffer = NULL,
  return = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of fossil occurrences you
wish to bin. This dataframe should contain the decimal degree coordinates of
your occurrences, and they should be of class \code{numeric}.}

\item{lng}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input longitude (e.g., "lng" or "p_lng").}

\item{lat}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input latitude (e.g., "lat" or "p_lat").}

\item{method}{\code{character}. The desired method for spatially binning
occurrence data. Either: "grid" or "dist". The "grid" method (default)
spatially bins data into equal-area hexagonal grid cells based on a
user-defined spacing between the center of adjacent cells. The "dist" method
generates spatial samples for each locality (i.e., unique coordinate pairs)
based on a user-defined distance. See details for further description.}

\item{dist}{\code{numeric}. Under the "grid" method, this value indicates
the desired spacing between the center of adjacent cells. Under the "dist"
method, this is the distance threshold for defining spatial samples of
occurrences. Note: \code{dist} should be provided in kilometres.}

\item{buffer}{\code{numeric}. The buffer distance for defining unique
localities. This argument allows the user to modify the definition of unique
localities to draw from a larger area than point coordinates. This might be
desirable if a high density of occurrences are in close proximity, but differ
slightly in their coordinates (e.g., < 1 kilometre).
Note: \code{buffer} should be provided in kilometres. The default value is \code{NULL},
which skips the buffer implementation.}

\item{return}{\code{logical}. Should the equal-area grid be returned?
Only useful if the method argument is set to "grid". The default is \code{FALSE.}}
}
\value{
If the \code{method} argument is specified as "grid" and \code{return} as
\code{FALSE}, a dataframe is returned of the original input \code{occdf} with
cell information: ID number (\code{cell_ID}) and cell centroid coordinates
(\code{cell_centroid_lng} and \code{cell_centroid_lat}). If \code{return} is
set to \code{TRUE}, a list is returned with both the input \code{occdf} and a dggs
object (equal-area hexagonal grid) from the
\code{\link[dggridR:dgconstruct]{dggridR::dgconstruct()}} function.
If the \code{method} argument is specified as "dist", a list is returned of
spatial samples drawn around unique localities based on the
user-defined \code{dist}. Each element of the list contains occurrences within
the geographic distance of the reference locality defined by the user.
}
\description{
A function to assign fossil occurrences to spatial bins/samples using a
hexagonal equal-area grid, or a distance-based approach.
}
\details{
Two approaches (methods) exist in the \code{bin_spatial()} function for
assigning occurrences to bins/samples:
\itemize{
\item Equal-area grid: The "grid" method bins fossil occurrence data into
equal-area grid cells using a hexagonal grid generated via the
\code{\link[dggridR:dgconstruct]{dggridR::dgconstruct()}} function.
\item Distance: The "dist" method identifies unique localities in the input
\code{occdf} (i.e., unique pairs of coordinates) and generates a spatial sample
for each locality based on a user-defined distance. All occurrences within
the specified distance from the reference locality are drawn as a single
spatial sample. As high density of occurrences might result in numerous
samples for the same area, the \code{buffer} argument has been implemented to
allow users to generalise the definition of
a unique locality to incorporate a broader geographic area. The
functionality of this approach is heavily
dependent on the
\code{\link[sf:st_is_within_distance]{sf::st_is_within_distance()}} function.
}

Note: prior to implementation of either method, the coordinate reference
system (CRS) for input data is defined as EPSG:4326 (World Geodetic System
1984). The user might wish to update their data accordingly if this is
not appropriate.

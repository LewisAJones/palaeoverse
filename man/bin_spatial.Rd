\title{Assign fossil occurrences to spatial bins}
\usage{
bin_spatial(
  occdf,
  lng = "lng",
  lat = "lat",
  method = "grid",
  dist = 250,
  buffer = NULL,
  return = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of fossil occurrences you
wish to bin. This dataframe should contain decimal degree coordinates of
your occurrences and they should be of class \code{numeric}.}

\item{lng}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input longitude (e.g., "lng" or "p_lng").}

\item{lat}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input latitude (e.g., "lat" or "p_lat").}

\item{method}{\code{character}. The desired method for spatially binning
occurrence data. Either: "grid" or "dist". The "grid" method (default)
spatially bins data into equal-area hexagonal grid cells based on a
user-defined spacing between the center of cells. The "dist" method
generates spatial samples for each locality (i.e., unique coordinates) based
on a user-defined distance. See details for further description.}

\item{dist}{\code{numeric}. Under the "grid" method, this value indicates
the desired spacing between the center of adjacent cells. Under the "dist"
method, this is the distance threshold for defining spatial samples of
occurrences. Note: \code{dist} should be provided in kilometres.}

\item{buffer}{\code{numeric}. The buffer distance for defining unique
localities. This argument allows the user to modify the definition of unique
localities to draw from a larger area than point coordinates. This might be
desirable if a high density of occurrences are in close proximity, but differ
slightly in their coordinates (e.g., < 1 kilometres.).
Note: \code{buffer} should be provided in kilometres. The default is NULL.}

\item{return}{\code{logical}. Should the equal-area grid be returned?
Only useful if the method argument is set to "grid". Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
If the \code{method} argument is specified as "grid" and \code{return} as
\code{FALSE}, a dataframe is returned of the original input \code{occdf} and the
cell ID number (\code{cell_ID}). If \code{return} is
set to \code{TRUE}, a list is returned with both the input \code{occdf} and a dggs
object (equal-area hexagonal grid) from the
\code{\link[dggridR:dgconstruct]{dggridR::dgconstruct()}} function.
If the \code{method} argument is specified as "dist", a list is returned of
spatial samples drawn around unique localities based on the
user-defined \code{dist}.
}
\description{
A function to assign fossil occurrences to spatial bins/samples using a
hexagonal equal-area grid, or a distance-based approach.
}
\details{
Two approaches (methods) exist in the \code{bin_spatial()} function for
assigning occurrences to bins/samples:
\itemize{
\item Equal-area grid: The "grid" method bins fossil occurrence data into
equal-area grid cells using a hexagonal grid generated via the
\code{\link[dggridR:dgconstruct]{dggridR::dgconstruct()}} function.
\item Distance: The "dist" method takes a slightly different approach to
previous spatially binning approaches in palaeobiology studies. This
approach looks for unique localities in the input \code{occdf} (i.e., unique
coordinates), and generates a spatial sample based on a user-defined \code{dist}.
All occurrences within this distance, are drawn as a single spatial sample.
This process is repeated for each unique locality. As high density of
occurrences might result in numerous samples for the same area, the \code{buffer}
argument has been implemented to allow users to generalise the definition of
a unique locality. The functionality of this approach is heavily
dependent on the
\code{\link[sf:st_is_within_distance]{sf::st_is_within_distance()}} function.
}

Note: prior to implementation of either method, the coordinate reference
system (CRS) for input data is defined as EPSG:4326 (World Geodetic System
1984). The user might wish to update their data accordingly if this is
problematic.

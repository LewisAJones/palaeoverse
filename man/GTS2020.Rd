\description{
A dataset of the Geological Time Scale 2020. Age data from:
\url{https://stratigraphy.org/timescale/}.
Definitions of relative climate states are also included in the dataset, and were compiled from various resources (see item descriptions).
Supplementary information is also included in the dataset for plotting functionality (e.g. GTS2020 colour scheme).

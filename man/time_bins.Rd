\usage{
time_bins(
  interval = c("Fortunian", "Meghalayan"),
  rank = "stage",
  size = NULL,
  assign = NULL,
  scale = "GTS2020",
  plot = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{interval}{\code{character or numeric}. Interval name of age available
in \code{\link{GTS2020}} or \code{\link{GTS2012}}.
If a single interval name is provided, this interval is returned.
If two interval names are provided, these intervals and those existing
between are returned. If a single numeric age is provided, the interval that
covers this age is returned.
If two interval ages are provided, the intervals occurring in the range of
these ages are returned. If higher-level units than stages are required,
these can only be specified using a  \code{character} input as the function
defaults to using stratigraphic stages for \code{numeric} inputs. The
default input for this argument is \verb{c("Fortunian", "Meghalayan"}).}

\item{rank}{\code{character}. Which stratigraphic rank is desired? Choose
from: "stage", "epoch", "period", "era", and "eon".
This argument defaults to NULL, in which case the rank will be identified
from the interval names.}

\item{size}{\code{numeric}. If equal-length time bins are desired, specify
the length in millions of years (Myr) of the time bins desired.}

\item{assign}{\code{numeric}. A numeric vector of age estimates (e.g.,
midpoint age in specified age range) to use to assign to bins of a given
size. If assign is specified, a numeric vector is returned of the midpoint
age of the specified bins. Note this is the simplified approach of
assignment in \code{palaeoverse}.
See \code{\link[palaeoverse]{time_binning}}
for a wider range of binning approaches.}

\item{scale}{\code{character}. Specify the desired geological timescale to
be used "GTS2020" or "GTS2012". "GTS2020" is the default.}

\item{plot}{\code{logical}. Should a plot of time bins be generated?}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} of time bins for the specified intervals or a
list with a \code{dataframe} of time bins and \code{numeric} vector of
binned age estimates (midpoint of specified bins) if assign is specified.
}
\description{
A function to generate time bins for a given study interval. This function
is flexible in that either stage-level or higher stratigraphic-level
(period) time bins can be called.
In addition, near equal-length time bins can be generated by grouping stages
together. In this implementation, intervals are grouped together in a way
that creates near equal-length time bins based on the user's specified bin
size (e.g., if a user specifies 10 Myr as their target bin size, the
function will generate groups of bins that have a mean bin length close to
10 Myr).
However, users may also want to consider grouping stages based on other
reasoning e.g. availability of outcrop (see Dean et al. (2020);
\doi{https://doi.org/10.1111/pala.12492}).
}
\details{
This function uses the Geological Timescale 2020 and the Geological
Timescale 2012 (depending on user specification).
Additional information on each timescale and source can be accessed via the
calls:
\itemize{
\item \code{?GTS2020}
\item \code{?GTS2012}
}

Available intervals names are also accessible via
\code{GTS2020$interval_name} or \code{GTS2012$interval_name}. Data from the
Geological Timescale 2020 and 2012 were compiled by Lewis A. Jones
(2022-07-02).

\examples{
#Using interval midpoint age
time_bins(interval = 10, plot = TRUE)

#Using interval age range
time_bins(interval = c(50, 100), plot = TRUE)

#Using a single interval name
time_bins(interval = c("Maastrichtian"), plot = TRUE)

#Using a range of intervals defined by two named intervals and equal
#duration bins
time_bins(interval = c("Fortunian", "Meghalayan"), size = 10, plot = TRUE)

#Assign bins based on given age estimates
time_bins(interval = c("Fortunian", "Meghalayan"), assign = c(232, 167, 33))

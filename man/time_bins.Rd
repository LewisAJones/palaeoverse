\usage{
time_bins(
  interval = c("Fortunian", "Meghalayan"),
  equal = FALSE,
  size = 10,
  plot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{interval}{\code{character or numeric}. Interval name of age available in \code{GTS2020}. If a single interval name is provided, this interval is returned.
If two interval names are provided, these intervals and those existing between are returned. If a single interval age is provided, the age matching this interval is returned.
If two interval ages are provided, the intervals occurring in the range of these ages are returned. If higher than stage bins are required, these can only be specified using a
\code{character} input as the function defaults to using stratigraphic stages for \code{numeric} inputs.}

\item{equal}{\code{logical}. Should near equal-length time bins be generated?}

\item{size}{\code{numeric}. If equal == \code{TRUE}, specify the length in millions of years (Myr) of the time bins desired. Defaults to 10 Myr.}

\item{plot}{\code{logical}. Should a plot of time bins be generated?}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} of time bins for a specified interval.
}
\description{
A function to generate time bins for a given study interval. This function is flexible in that either stage-level or higher bins can be generated. In addition, the option to
generate near equal-length time bins by grouping stages together is available. In this implementation, intervals are grouped together in a way that minimises the mean and
standard deviation between bins based on the user's specified bin size. However, users may also wish to group stages based on subjective reasoning e.g.availability of outcrop.
}
\details{
This function uses the Geological Timescale 2020. Age data were compiled from: \url{https://stratigraphy.org/timescale/}.
Available intervals names are accessible via GTS2020$interval_name.

\examples{
Using interval midpoint age
time_bins(interval = 10, equal = FALSE, plot = TRUE)

Using interval age range
time_bins(interval = c(50, 100), equal = FALSE, plot = TRUE)

Using a single interval name
time_bins(interval = c("Maastrichtian"), equal = FALSE, plot = TRUE)

Using a range of intervals defined by two named intervals and equal duration bins
time_bins(interval = c("Fortunian", "Meghalayan"), equal = TRUE, size = 10, plot = TRUE)
}

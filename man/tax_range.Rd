\title{Calculate the range of fossil taxa}
\usage{
tax_range(occdf, method = "temporal", plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of the fossil occurrences you
wish to calculate range metrics for. For the "temporal" method, the
dataframe should contain at least the following columns: "name"
(e.g., species name), "max_ma", and "min_ma". For the "latitudinal" method,
the dataframe should contain at least the following columns: "name" and
"p_lat" (i.e., palaeolatitude). For the "spatial" method, the dataframe
should contain at least the following columns: "name", "p_lng" and "p_lat".}

\item{method}{\code{character}. The type of ranges you wish to calculate
for each unique taxa in the occurrence dataframe. Three options exist in
this function: "temporal", "latitudinal", and "spatial". See Details for a
description of each.}

\item{plot}{\code{logical}. Should a plot of the ranges be generated?}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} with method specific columns. For the "temporal"
method, a \code{dataframe} with unique taxa (\code{name}), taxa ID (\code{taxa_id}),
maximum age of occurrence (\code{max_ma}), minimum age of occurrence
(\code{min_ma}) and range duration (\code{range_myr}) is returned. For the
"latitudinal" method, a \code{dataframe} with unique taxa (\code{name}),
taxa ID (\code{taxa_id}), maximum palaeolatitude of occurrence (\code{max_p_lat}),
minimum palaeolatitude of occurrence (\code{min_p_lat}) and palaeolatitudinal
range (\code{range_p_lat}) is returned.
}
\description{
A function to calculate various types of ranges for fossil taxa. The
function can calculate either temporal, (palaeo-)latitudinal, or the spatial
range of taxa.
}
\details{
Three approaches (methods) exist in the \code{tax_range} function for
calculating ranges:
\itemize{
\item Temporal: the "temporal" method calculates the temporal range of a taxa.
It does so by extracting all unique taxa from the input \code{occdf} and
checking their first and last appearance. Subsequently, the temporal range
of each taxa is calculated.
\item Latitudinal: the "latitudinal" method calculates the (palaeo-)latitudinal
range of a taxa. It does so by extracting all unique taxa from the input
\code{occdf} and checking their most notherly and southerly occurrence.
Subsequently, the latitudinal range of each taxa is calculated.
\item Spatial:

# Grab internal data
occdf <- tetrapods
# Add name column
occdf$name <- occdf$accepted_name
# Temporal range
tax_range(occdf = occdf, method = "temporal", plot = TRUE)
# Latitudinal range
occdf$p_lat <- occdf$lat

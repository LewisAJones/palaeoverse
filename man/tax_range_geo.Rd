}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of fossil occurrences.
This dataframe should contain at least three columns: names of taxa
(\code{character}), longitude (\code{numeric}) and latitude (\code{numeric}).}

\item{name}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input names (e.g., "species" or "genus"). NA data should be removed
prior to function call.}

\item{lng}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input longitude (e.g., "lng" or "p_lng").}

\item{lat}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input latitude (e.g., "lat" or "p_lat").}

\item{method}{\code{character}. How should geographic range be calculated
for each taxon in \code{occdf}? Four options exist in this function:
"con", "lat", "gcd", and "occ". See Details for a description of each.}

\item{spacing}{\code{numeric}. The desired spacing (in km) between the
center of adjacent grid cells. Only useful if the \code{method} argument is set
to "occ". The default is 100.}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} with method-specific columns:
\itemize{
\item For the "con" method, a \code{dataframe} with unique taxa (\code{taxa}),
taxon ID (\code{taxon_id}), convex hull coordinates (\code{lng} & \code{lat}), and area
(\code{area}) in km\ifelse{html}{\out{<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{^2}} is returned.
\item For the "lat" method, a \code{dataframe} with unique taxa (\code{taxa}),
taxon ID (\code{taxon_id}), maximum latitude of occurrence (\code{max_lat}),
minimum latitude of occurrence (\code{min_lat}), and latitudinal
range (\code{range_lat}) is returned.
\item For the "gcd" method, a \code{dataframe} with unique taxa (\code{taxa}), taxon
ID (\code{taxon_id}), coordinates of the two most distant points
(\code{lng} & \code{lat}), and the 'Great Circle Distance' (\code{GCD}) between these
points in km is returned.
\item For the "occ" method, a \code{dataframe} with unique taxa (\code{taxa}), taxon
ID (\code{taxon_id}), the number of occupied cells (\code{cells}), and the spacing
between cells (\code{spacing}) in km is returned.
For the "con", "lat" and "gcd" method, values of zero indicate that the
respective taxon is a singleton (i.e. represented by only one occurrence).

\description{
A function to calculate the geographic range of fossil taxa from occurrence
data. The function can calculate geographic range in four ways: convex hull,
latitudinal range, maximum great circle distance, and the number of
occupied equal-area hexagonal grid cells.
}
\details{
Four commonly applied approaches (Darroch et al., 2020)
are available using the \code{tax_range_geo} function for calculating ranges:
\itemize{
\item Convex hull: the "con" method calculates the geographic range of taxa
using a convex hull for each taxon in \code{occdf}, and calculates the area of
the convex hull (in km\ifelse{html}{\out{<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{^2}}) using
\code{\link[geosphere:areaPolygon]{geosphere::areaPolygon()}}. The
convex hull method works by creating a polygon that encompasses all
occurrence points of the taxon.
\item Latitudinal: the "lat" method calculates the palaeolatitudinal
range of a taxa. It does so for each taxon in \code{occdf} by finding their
maximum and minimum latitudinal occurrence.
The palaeolatitudinal range of each taxa is also calculated.
\item Maximum Great Circle Distance: the "gcd" method calculates the maximum
Great Circle Distance between occurrences for each taxon in \code{occdf}. It does
so using \code{\link[fields:rdist.earth]{fields::rdist.earth()}}. This
function calculates Great Circle Distance using the Haversine method with
the radius of the Earth set to the 6378.388 km (equatorial radius).
Great Circle Distance represents the shortest distance between two
points on the surface of a sphere. This is different from Euclidean Distance,
which represents the distance between two points on a plane.
\item Occupied cells: the "occ" method calculates the number of occupied
equal-area grid cells. It does so using discrete hexagonal grids via the
\code{\link[h3jsr]{h3jsr}} package. This package relies on Uber's H3 library,
a geospatial indexing system that partitions the world into hexagonal cells:
\url{https://h3geo.org/docs}. In H3, 16 different resolutions are available:
\url{https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable}. In the implementation of
the \code{tax_range_geo()} function, the resolution is defined by the user-input
\code{spacing} which represents the distance between the centroid of adjacent
cells. Using this distance, the function identifies which resolution is most
similar to the input \code{spacing}, and uses this resolution.

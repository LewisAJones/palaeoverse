\title{Calculate the geographic range of fossil taxa}
\usage{
tax_range_geo(occdf, method = "lat", plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of fossil occurrences.
For the dataframe should contain the following named columns: "name"
(e.g., species name), "p_lng" and "p_lat" (i.e., palaeolatitude and
palaeolongitude). However, only "p_lat" is required for the "lat" method.}

\item{method}{\code{character}. How do you want to calculate the
geographic range for each unique taxa in \code{occdf}? Four options exist in
this function: "con", "lat", "gcd", and "occ". See Details for a
description of each.}

\item{plot}{\code{logical}. Should a plot of the ranges be generated?}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} with method specific columns. For the "con"
method, a \code{dataframe} with unique taxa (\code{name}), taxa ID (\code{taxa_id}),
convex hull coordinates (\code{p_lng} & \code{p_lat}), and area (\code{area}) in km^2 is
returned. For the "lat" method, a \code{dataframe} with unique taxa (\code{name}),
taxa ID (\code{taxa_id}), maximum palaeolatitude of occurrence (\code{max_p_lat}),
minimum palaeolatitude of occurrence (\code{min_p_lat}), and palaeolatitudinal
range (\code{range_p_lat}) is returned. For the "gcr" method...
For the "occ" method...
}
\description{
A function to calculate the geographic range of fossil taxa. The function
calculates geographic range in four ways: convex hull, latitudinal range,
maximum great circle distance and the number of occupied grid cells.
}
\details{
Three approaches (methods) exist in the \code{tax_range} function for
calculating ranges:
\itemize{
\item Temporal: the "temporal" method calculates the temporal range of a taxa.
It does so by extracting all unique taxa (\code{name} column) from the input
\code{occdf}, and checks their first and last appearance. The temporal range
of each taxa is also calculated.
\item Latitudinal: the "lat" method calculates the (palaeo-) latitudinal
range of a taxa. It does so by extracting all unique taxa (\code{name} column)
from the input \code{occdf} and finding their most northerly and southerly
occurrence. The latitudinal range of each taxa is also calculated.
\item Geographic: the "geo" method calculates the geographic range of a taxa. It
does so by generating a convex hull for each taxa in the \code{occdf}, and
calculates the area of the convex hull (in km^2) using
\code{\link[geosphere:areaPolygon]{geosphere::areaPolygon()}}.

\title{Calculate the geographic range of fossil taxa}
\usage{
tax_range_geo(
  occdf,
  name = "name",
  lng = "lng",
  lat = "lat",
  method = "lat",
  spacing = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of fossil occurrences.
This dataframe should contain at least three columns: names of taxa
(\code{character}), longitude (\code{numeric}) and latitude (\code{numeric}).}

\item{name}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input names (e.g., "species" or "genus").}

\item{lng}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input longitude (e.g., "lng" or "p_lng").}

\item{lat}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input latitude (e.g., "lat" or "p_lat").}

\item{method}{\code{character}. How should geographic range be calculated
for each taxa in \code{occdf}? Four options exist in this function:
"con", "lat", "gcd", and "occ". See Details for a description of each.}

\item{spacing}{\code{numeric}. The desired spacing (in km) between the
center of adjacent grid cells. Only useful if the \code{method} argument is set
to "occ". The default is 100.}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} with method specific columns:
\itemize{
\item For the "con" method, a \code{dataframe} with unique taxa (\code{taxa}),
taxa ID (\code{taxa_id}), convex hull coordinates (\code{lng} & \code{lat}), and area
(\code{area}) in km\ifelse{html}{\out{<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{^2}} is returned.
\item For the "lat" method, a \code{dataframe} with unique taxa (\code{taxa}),
taxa ID (\code{taxa_id}), maximum latitude of occurrence (\code{max_lat}),
minimum latitude of occurrence (\code{min_lat}), and latitudinal
range (\code{range_lat}) is returned.
\item For the "gcd" method, a \code{dataframe} with unique taxa (\code{taxa}), taxa
ID (\code{taxa_id}), coordinates of the two most distant points
(\code{lng} & \code{lat}), and the 'Great Circle Distance' (\code{GCD}) between these
points in km is returned.
\item For the "occ" method, a \code{dataframe} with unique taxa (\code{taxa}), taxa
ID (\code{taxa_id}), the number of occupied cells (\code{cells}), and the spacing
between cells (\code{spacing}) in km is returned.
}
}
\description{
A function to calculate the geographic range of fossil taxa. The function
can calculate geographic range in four ways: convex hull, latitudinal range,
maximum great circle distance, and the number of occupied equal-area
hexagonal grid cells.
}
\details{
Four approaches (methods) exist in the \code{tax_range_geo} function for
calculating ranges:
\itemize{
\item Convex hull: the "con" method calculates the geographic range of a taxa
using a convex hull for each taxa in \code{occdf}, and calculates the area of
the convex hull (in km\ifelse{html}{\out{<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{^2}}) using
\code{\link[geosphere:areaPolygon]{geosphere::areaPolygon()}}.
\item Latitudinal: the "lat" method calculates the palaeolatitudinal
range of a taxa. It does so for each taxa in \code{occdf} by finding their most
northern and southern occurrence. The palaeolatitudinal range of each taxa
is also calculated.
\item Maximum Great Circle Distance: the "gcd" method calculates the maximum
Great Circle Distance between occurrences for each taxa in \code{occdf}. It does
so using \code{\link[fields:rdist.earth]{fields::rdist.earth()}}. This
function calculates Great Circle Distance using the Haversine method with
the radius of the Earth set to the 6378.388 km (equatorial radius).
\item Occupied cells: the "occ" method calculates the number of occupied
grid cells. It does so using discrete hexagonal grids via the
\code{\link[h3jsr]{h3jsr}} package. This package relies on Uber's H3 library,
a geospatial indexing system that partitions the world into hexagonal cells:
\url{https://h3geo.org/docs}. In H3, 16 different resolutions are available:
\url{https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable}. In the implementation of
the \code{tax_range_geo()} function, the resolution is defined by the user-input
\code{spacing} which represents the distance between the centroid of adjacent
cells. Using this distance, the function identifies which resolution is most
similar to the input \code{spacing}, and uses this resolution.

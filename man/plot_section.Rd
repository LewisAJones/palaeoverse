\usage{
plot_section(
  occdf,
  name = "taxon",
  level = "bed",
  certainty = NULL,
  by = "FAD",
  xlab = "",
  ylab = "",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of fossil occurrences containing
at least two columns: names of taxa, and their stratigraphic position (see
\code{name} and \code{level} arguments).}

\item{name}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input names, e.g. "taxon" (default).}

\item{level}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the stratigraphic levels associated with each occurrence, e.g. "bed"
(default) or "height".}

\item{certainty}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be
treated as the information on whether an identification is certain ("1") or
uncertain ("0"). By default (\code{certainty = NULL}), no column name is
provided, and all occurrences are assumed to be certain. In the plot, any
occurrence labelled as certain will be plotted with a black circle, while
any occurrence labelled as uncertain will be plotted with a white circle.}

\item{by}{\code{character}. How should the output be sorted? Either: "FAD"
(first appearance; default), "LAD" (last appearance), or "name"
(alphabetically by taxon names).}

\item{xlab}{\code{character}. The x-axis label (over taxa) passed directly to
\code{plot}.}

\item{ylab}{\code{character}. The y-axis label (over strata) passed directly
to \code{plot}.}

\item{...}{Further arguments that are passed directly to \code{plot}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a data.frame of the calculated taxonomic
stratigraphic ranges.

Function is usually used for its side effect, which is to create a plot
showing the stratigraphic ranges of taxa in a section, with levels at which
the taxon was sampled indicated with a point.
}
\description{
A function to plot the stratigraphic ranges of fossil taxa from occurrence
data.

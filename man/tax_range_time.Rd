\title{Calculate the temporal range of fossil taxa}
\usage{
tax_range_time(occdf, scale = "GTS2020", plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of fossil occurrences. The
dataframe should contain the following named columns: "name"
(e.g., species name), "max_ma", and "min_ma". The columns "max_ma" and
"min_ma" should be of class \code{numeric} and provide the age range of the
fossil occurrence in millions of years before present. However, if they are
provided as \code{character} (i.e. stage names), the function will try to
extract numeric age data from the Geological Timescale by linking stage
names.}

\item{scale}{\code{character}. Specify the desired geological timescale to
be used "GTS2020" or "GTS2012". This argument is only useful if the supplied
"max_ma" and "min_ma" columns are of class \code{character}.
"GTS2020" is the default.}

\item{plot}{\code{logical}. Should a plot of the ranges be generated?}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} containing the following columns:
unique taxa (\code{name}), taxa ID (\code{taxa_id}), first appearnce of taxa
(\code{FAD_ma}), last appearance of taxa (\code{LAD_ma}), and range duration
(\code{range_myr}) is returned.
}
\description{
A function to calculate the temporal range of fossil taxa.
}
\details{
The temporal range(s) of taxa are calculated by extracting all
unique taxa (\code{name} column) from the input \code{occdf}, and checking their first
and last appearance. The temporal duration of each taxa is also calculated.

\title{Calculate the temporal range of fossil taxa}
\usage{
tax_range_time(
  occdf,
  name = "name",
  min_ma = "min_ma",
  max_ma = "max_ma",
  scale = "GTS2020",
  plot = FALSE,
  return_error = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of fossil occurrences. The
dataframe should contain at least three columns: names of taxa (\code{character})
and the maximum (\code{numeric}) and minimum (\code{numeric}) age which constrain the
age range (in millions of years) of the fossil occurrence. If the age range
columns are provided as (\code{character}) values (i.e., stage names), the
function will attempt to extract numeric age data from the
Geological Timescale by linking stage names.}

\item{name}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input names (e.g., "species" or "genus").}

\item{min_ma}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input minimum age range (e.g., "min_ma").}

\item{max_ma}{\code{character}. The name of the column you wish to be treated
as the input maximum age range (e.g., "max_ma").}

\item{scale}{\code{character}. Specify the desired geological timescale to
be used "GTS2020" or "GTS2012". This argument is only useful if the supplied
"max_ma" and "min_ma" columns are of class \code{character}.
"GTS2020" is the default.}

\item{plot}{\code{logical}. Should a plot of the ranges be generated?}

\item{return_error}{\code{logical}. Should a vector of numbers be returned
to flag the rows of the \code{occdf} that cannot be matched to \code{character}
interval names? This is only relevant if \code{max_ma} and \code{min_ma}
are \code{character} values.}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} containing the following columns:
unique taxa (\code{taxa}), taxa ID (\code{taxa_id}), first appearance of taxa
(\code{FAD_ma}), last appearance of taxa (\code{LAD_ma}), and temporal range duration
(\code{range_myr}) is returned.
}
\description{
A function to calculate the temporal range of fossil taxa.
}
\details{
The temporal range(s) of taxa are calculated by extracting all
unique taxa (\code{name} column) from the input \code{occdf}, and checking their first
and last appearance. The temporal duration of each taxa is also calculated.

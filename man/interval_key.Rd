\title{Example dataset: Interval key for the look_up function}
\format{
A data frame with 783 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
\item{interval_name}{Stratigraphic interval}
\item{early_stage}{Earliest (oldest) geological stage which overlaps with
the interval}
\item{late_stage}{Latest (youngest) geological stage which overlaps with
the interval}
}
}
\source{
Compiled by K. Eichenseer for assigning geological stages to
occurrences from the Paleobiology Database and the Paleoreefs Database.

\usage{

\description{
A table of geological intervals and the earliest and latest
corresponding international geological stage. The table was compiled using
regional stratigraphies, the Geowhen Database
(\url{https://timescalefoundation.org/resources/geowhen/}), temporal
information from the Paleobiology Database
(\url{https://paleobiodb.org/classic/displaySearchStrataForm}) and the
Geological Timescale 2016
(\url{https://stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2016-10.pdf}).
Some assignments were made with incomplete information on
the stratigraphic provenance of intervals. The assignments in this
table are tentative and should be verified before use.

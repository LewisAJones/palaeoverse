\title{Example dataset: Interval key for the look_up function}
\format{
A data frame with 783 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
\item{interval_name}{Stratigraphic interval}
\item{early_stage}{Earliest (oldest) geological stage which overlaps with
the interval}
\item{late_stage}{Latest (youngest) geological stage which overlaps with
the interval}
}
}
\source{
Compiled by K. Eichenseer for assigning geological stages to
occurrences from the \href{https://paleobiodb.org}{Paleobiology Database}
and the \href{https://www.paleo-reefs.pal.uni-erlangen.de/}{Paleoreefs Database}.

\description{
A table of geological intervals and the earliest and latest
corresponding international geological stages from the International
Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). The table was compiled using
regional stratigraphies, the \href{https://timescalefoundation.org/resources/geowhen/}{Geowhen Database}, temporal
information from the \href{https://paleobiodb.org/classic/displaySearchStrataForm}{Paleobiology Database} and the
\href{https://stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2016-10.pdf}{Geological Timescale 2016}.
Some assignments were made with incomplete information on
the stratigraphic provenance of intervals. The assignments in this
table should be verified before research use.

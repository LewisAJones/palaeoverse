\title{Example dataset: Interval key for the look_up function}
\format{
A data frame with 783 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
\item{interval_name}{Stratigraphic interval}
\item{early_stage}{Earliest (oldest) geological stage which overlaps with
the interval}
\item{late_stage}{Latest (youngest) geological stage which overlaps with
the interval}
}

\source{
Compiled by K. Eichenseer for assigning geological stages to
occurrences from the Paleobiology Database and the Paleoreefs Database.}

\usage{

}
\description{
A table of geological intervals and the earliest and latest
corresponding international geological stage. The table was compiled using
regional stratigraphies, the \link{Geowhen database}
(https://timescalefoundation.org/resources/geowhen/), temporal information
from the \link{Paleobiology Database}
(https://paleobiodb.org/classic/displaySearchStrataForm) and the Geological
Timescale 2016. Some assignments were made with incomplete information on
the stratigraphic provenance of intervals. The assignments in this
table are tentative and should be verified before use.

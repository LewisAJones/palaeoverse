\title{Look up geological intervals and assign ICS ages and stages}
\usage{
look_up(
  occdf,
  interval_key,
  assign_with_GTS = "GTS2020",
  early_interval = NULL,
  late_interval = NULL,
  print_assigned = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{occdf}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe of the fossil occurrences you
wish to bin. The following named columns need to be contained:
\code{early_interval} and, optionally, \code{late_interval}. These columns need
to be \code{character} values. If no \code{late_interval} is supplied, only
\code{early_interval} is used, and it is assumed that the occurrences are from
that interval only.}

\item{interval_key}{\code{dataframe}. A dataframe linking interval names to
international, geological stage names, or other, user-defined intervals.
This dataframe should contain the following named columns containing
\code{character} values:
\code{interval_name} contains the names to be matched from \code{occdf},
\code{early_stage} contains the names of the earliest or only stages corresponding
to the interval, and, optionally,
\code{late_stage} contains the latest stage corresponding to the
interval.
Optionally, \code{numeric} columns \code{max_ma} and \code{min_ma} can provide maximal
and minimal ages for the intervals.}

\item{assign_with_GTS}{\code{character} or \code{FALSE}. Allows intervals to
be searched in the \code{GTS2020} (default) or the \code{GTS2012} table. Set to
\code{FALSE} to disable.}

\item{early_interval}{\code{character}. Alternative column name that contains
the earliest or only interval from which the occurrences are from.}

\item{late_interval}{\code{character}. Alternative column name that contains
the latest interval from which the occurrences are from.}

\item{print_assigned}{\code{logical}. Should the assigned interval names be printed?
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{dataframe} of the original input \code{data} with the following
appended columns is returned: \code{early_stage} and \code{late_stage}, corresponding
to the earliest and latest international geological stage which
could be assigned to the occurrence based on the given interval names. If
provided in the \code{interval_key}, \code{max_ma} and \code{min_ma} return maximal and minimal ages
for the intervals, and a column \code{mid_ma} is appended to provide the midpoint
age of the interval.
}
\description{
A function to assign fossil occurrences to international geological stages
or user-defined intervals based on interval names.
}
\details{
Instead of  geological stages, the user can supply any names in the
\code{early_stage} and \code{late_stage} column, in which case \code{assign_with_GTS} should
be set to \code{FALSE}.

An exemplary \code{interval_key} can be used by setting
\code{interval_key = "example"}. This key works well for assigning
geological stages to many of the
intervals from the Paleobiology Database and the Paleoreefs Database.
Palaeoverse can provide no guaranty that all of the assignments with the
exemplary key are accurate.

\title{Check phylogeny tip names}
\usage{
phylo_check(tree = NULL, list = NULL, out = "table", sort = "presence")
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{\code{phylo}. A phylo object containing the phylogeny.}

\item{list}{\code{character}. A vector of taxon names. Binomials can be
separated with either a space or an underscore. The names should not contain
any other punctuation.}

\item{out}{\code{character}. Determine whether to return either a
\code{dataframe} describing which taxa are included or not included in the
tree ("table", the default), the counts of taxa included and not included in
the tree ("counts"), or the phylogeny trimmed to only include taxa in the
provided list ("tree").}

\item{sort}{\code{character}. If out = "table", sort the names by presence in
the tree ("presence", the default), or alphabetically ("az").}
}
\value{
If out = "table", a \code{dataframe} describing whether taxon names
are present in the list and/or the tree. If out = "counts", a summary table
containing the number of taxa in the list but not the tree, in the tree but
not the list, and in both. If out = "tree", a phylo object consisting of the
input phylogeny trimmed to only include the tips present in the list.
}
\description{
A function to check the list of tip names in a phylogeny against a vector of
taxon names, and if desired, to trim the phylogeny to only include taxon
names within the vector.
}
\details{
Phylogenies can be read into R from .txt or .tree files containing
the Newick formatted tree using \code{\link[ape:read.tree]{ape::read.tree()}}, and can be saved as
files using \code{\link[ape:write.tree]{ape::write.tree()}}.

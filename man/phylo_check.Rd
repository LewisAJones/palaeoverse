\title{Check phylogeny tip names}
\usage{
phylo_check(tree, list, out = "counts")
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{\code{phylo}. A phylo object. Phylogenies can be read into R from
.txt or .tree files containing the Newick formatted tree using
\code{ape::read.tree}.}

\item{list}{\code{character}. A vector of taxon names. Binomials can be
separated with either a space or an underscore. The list should not contain
any punctuation.}

\item{out}{\code{character}. Determine whether to return either the counts
of taxa included and not included in the tree ("counts", the default), a
\code{dataframe} describing which taxa are included or not included in the
tree ("table"), or the phylogeny trimmed to only include taxa in the provided
list ("tree").}
}
\value{
If out = "counts", a summary table containing the number of taxa in
the list but not the tree, in the tree but not the list, and in both. If out
= "table", a \code{dataframe} describing whether taxon names are present in
the list and/or the tree. If out = "tree", the input phylogeny trimmed to
only include the tips present in the list; you can save your new tree using
\code{ape::write.tree}.
}
\description{
A function to check the list of tip names in a phylogeny against a vector of
taxon names, and if desired, to trim the phylogeny to only include taxon
names within the vector.

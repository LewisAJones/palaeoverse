The bed from which the fossils come is a deep red shale, exposed on a series of hills over an area about an eighth of a mile on each side. This bed is capped in many places by a thin, dense siltstone. Overlying the siltstone is an orange-red shale that carries gypsum biscuits. Underlying the producing layer, which averages about four feet in thickness, is a brownish-red shale that is devoid\r\nof fossils. The most distinctive feature of the bone-bearing shale, outside of the fact that it has fossils, is the occurrence of two types of vertically oriented ovoid structures. One type consists of mottled red and green, hard nodules that range from one to four inches in maximum diameter and up to eighteen inches in length. They are rich in vertebrate remains. They appear to have formed around the bones after deposition, presumably as a result of the reducing action of organic materials. Their vertical orientation is somewhat\r\npuzzling. The contained vertebrate remains are usually oriented with their long axes vertical, and it seems quite certain that this position was attained after the formation of the nodules. Specimens of vertebrates free in the shale rather than in nodules are orientated with their long axes horizontal and have been subjected to considerable distortion and breakage. The most reasonable suggestion seems to be that the vertical orientation of the nodules was developed during compaction of the shales, which has been extensive, with the long axes shifting to become normal to the compacting forces.\r\nThe other vertical structures [...] have been termed pipes and have given the name to the site. They pass from the base to the top of the fossiliferous bed and, at the top, are continuous with the siltstone layer that caps the bed. Their composition is similar to the capping siltstone. The pipes are oval in cross section with maximum diameters from about four to twelve inches. Orientation of the long diameters is random, even in the 'clumps' in which the pipes tend to occur. These structures do not contain vertebrates, although specimens are found 'plastered' to their sides and occasionally penetrating the pipe for a short distance.\r\nThe origin of the pipes is by no means certain. It is thought that they were formed in open holes by the introduction of the sediment that formed the siltstone layer. Superficially, they resemble lungfish burrows of the Arroyo and Vale (Romer and Olson, 1954), but the shape, size, composition, weathering, and fossil content differ. The most probable explanation is that these openings were formed by the root-like shafts of some type of plant, possibly some\r\nEquisetales, that rotted to leave openings that were later filled by sediment. There is no question that the red shales surrounding the pipes were deposited in a shallow pond, and such a pond might well have provided suitable habitat for the type of vegetation envisaged.""

The bed from which the fossils come is a deep red shale, exposed on a series of hills over an area about an eighth of a mile on each side. This bed is capped in many places by a thin, dense siltstone. Overlying the siltstone is an orange-red shale that carries gypsum biscuits. Underlying the producing layer, which averages about four feet in thickness, is a brownish-red shale that is devoid\r\nof fossils. The most distinctive feature of the bone-bearing shale, outside of the fact that it has fossils, is the occurrence of two types of vertically oriented ovoid structures. One type consists of mottled red and green, hard nodules that range from one to four inches in maximum diameter and up to eighteen inches in length. They are rich in vertebrate remains. They appear to have formed around the bones after deposition, presumably as a result of the reducing action of organic materials. Their vertical orientation is somewhat\r\npuzzling. The contained vertebrate remains are usually oriented with their long axes vertical, and it seems quite certain that this position was attained after the formation of the nodules. Specimens of vertebrates free in the shale rather than in nodules are orientated with their long axes horizontal and have been subjected to considerable distortion and breakage. The most reasonable suggestion seems to be that the vertical orientation of the nodules was developed during compaction of the shales, which has been extensive, with the long axes shifting to become normal to the compacting forces.\r\nThe other vertical structures [...] have been termed pipes and have given the name to the site. They pass from the base to the top of the fossiliferous bed and, at the top, are continuous with the siltstone layer that caps the bed. Their composition is similar to the capping siltstone. The pipes are oval in cross section with maximum diameters from about four to twelve inches. Orientation of the long diameters is random, even in the 'clumps' in which the pipes tend to occur. These structures do not contain vertebrates, although specimens are found 'plastered' to their sides and occasionally penetrating the pipe for a short distance.\r\nThe origin of the pipes is by no means certain. It is thought that they were formed in open holes by the introduction of the sediment that formed the siltstone layer. Superficially, they resemble lungfish burrows of the Arroyo and Vale (Romer and Olson, 1954), but the shape, size, composition, weathering, and fossil content differ. The most probable explanation is that these openings were formed by the root-like shafts of some type of plant, possibly some\r\nEquisetales, that rotted to leave openings that were later filled by sediment. There is no question that the red shales surrounding the pipes were deposited in a shallow pond, and such a pond might well have provided suitable habitat for the type of vegetation envisaged.""

The bed from which the fossils come is a deep red shale, exposed on a series of hills over an area about an eighth of a mile on each side. This bed is capped in many places by a thin, dense siltstone. Overlying the siltstone is an orange-red shale that carries gypsum biscuits. Underlying the producing layer, which averages about four feet in thickness, is a brownish-red shale that is devoid\r\nof fossils. The most distinctive feature of the bone-bearing shale, outside of the fact that it has fossils, is the occurrence of two types of vertically oriented ovoid structures. One type consists of mottled red and green, hard nodules that range from one to four inches in maximum diameter and up to eighteen inches in length. They are rich in vertebrate remains. They appear to have formed around the bones after deposition, presumably as a result of the reducing action of organic materials. Their vertical orientation is somewhat\r\npuzzling. The contained vertebrate remains are usually oriented with their long axes vertical, and it seems quite certain that this position was attained after the formation of the nodules. Specimens of vertebrates free in the shale rather than in nodules are orientated with their long axes horizontal and have been subjected to considerable distortion and breakage. The most reasonable suggestion seems to be that the vertical orientation of the nodules was developed during compaction of the shales, which has been extensive, with the long axes shifting to become normal to the compacting forces.\r\nThe other vertical structures [...] have been termed pipes and have given the name to the site. They pass from the base to the top of the fossiliferous bed and, at the top, are continuous with the siltstone layer that caps the bed. Their composition is similar to the capping siltstone. The pipes are oval in cross section with maximum diameters from about four to twelve inches. Orientation of the long diameters is random, even in the 'clumps' in which the pipes tend to occur. These structures do not contain vertebrates, although specimens are found 'plastered' to their sides and occasionally penetrating the pipe for a short distance.\r\nThe origin of the pipes is by no means certain. It is thought that they were formed in open holes by the introduction of the sediment that formed the siltstone layer. Superficially, they resemble lungfish burrows of the Arroyo and Vale (Romer and Olson, 1954), but the shape, size, composition, weathering, and fossil content differ. The most probable explanation is that these openings were formed by the root-like shafts of some type of plant, possibly some\r\nEquisetales, that rotted to leave openings that were later filled by sediment. There is no question that the red shales surrounding the pipes were deposited in a shallow pond, and such a pond might well have provided suitable habitat for the type of vegetation envisaged.""

The bed from which the fossils come is a deep red shale, exposed on a series of hills over an area about an eighth of a mile on each side. This bed is capped in many places by a thin, dense siltstone. Overlying the siltstone is an orange-red shale that carries gypsum biscuits. Underlying the producing layer, which averages about four feet in thickness, is a brownish-red shale that is devoid\r\nof fossils. The most distinctive feature of the bone-bearing shale, outside of the fact that it has fossils, is the occurrence of two types of vertically oriented ovoid structures. One type consists of mottled red and green, hard nodules that range from one to four inches in maximum diameter and up to eighteen inches in length. They are rich in vertebrate remains. They appear to have formed around the bones after deposition, presumably as a result of the reducing action of organic materials. Their vertical orientation is somewhat\r\npuzzling. The contained vertebrate remains are usually oriented with their long axes vertical, and it seems quite certain that this position was attained after the formation of the nodules. Specimens of vertebrates free in the shale rather than in nodules are orientated with their long axes horizontal and have been subjected to considerable distortion and breakage. The most reasonable suggestion seems to be that the vertical orientation of the nodules was developed during compaction of the shales, which has been extensive, with the long axes shifting to become normal to the compacting forces.\r\nThe other vertical structures [...] have been termed pipes and have given the name to the site. They pass from the base to the top of the fossiliferous bed and, at the top, are continuous with the siltstone layer that caps the bed. Their composition is similar to the capping siltstone. The pipes are oval in cross section with maximum diameters from about four to twelve inches. Orientation of the long diameters is random, even in the 'clumps' in which the pipes tend to occur. These structures do not contain vertebrates, although specimens are found 'plastered' to their sides and occasionally penetrating the pipe for a short distance.\r\nThe origin of the pipes is by no means certain. It is thought that they were formed in open holes by the introduction of the sediment that formed the siltstone layer. Superficially, they resemble lungfish burrows of the Arroyo and Vale (Romer and Olson, 1954), but the shape, size, composition, weathering, and fossil content differ. The most probable explanation is that these openings were formed by the root-like shafts of some type of plant, possibly some\r\nEquisetales, that rotted to leave openings that were later filled by sediment. There is no question that the red shales surrounding the pipes were deposited in a shallow pond, and such a pond might well have provided suitable habitat for the type of vegetation envisaged.""

This carbonate facies assemblage (the so-called “dolomitic bank”) is overlain by dark-grey and bituminous black shales interbedded with limestones and dolomites (“rhythmic zone”; Fig. 5). Crustacean shell-beds also occur in this facies. According to Lavina (1991) this rhythmic facies, with recurrently associated carbonates and shales, are distal tempestites linked to deposition from turbulent currents induced by storms and deposited below the baselevel of the storm wave action. Most of the articulated mesosaur specimens (Class I) have been collected from the top of the lower dolomitic bed, close to its boundary with the overlying rhythmic facies.

Detailed logging of the sedimentary sequence above and below the fossil locality shows several similar nodular horizons interbedded with tabular greenish grey fine-grained sandstone bodies. These mudrocks are interpreted as proximal floodplain deposits that mainly accumulated from episodic flooding of rivers on a semi-arid alluvial plain. The nodules are composed of micrite and interpreted to be of pedogenic origin formed in the B horizon of an arid zone calcic palaeosol. Preferential micritization around buried bone began with bacterial decay that produced a reduction halo around the bones some 0.5 m below the floodplain surface. Later, microcrystalline calcium carbonate was precipitated from groundwater within the reduction envelope and onto the bone surface. The uncompressed state of the skull attests to the early lithi®cation of the calcareous nodule, before the surrounding mud was fully compacted. \r\nAssociated sandstone bodies are up to 4 m thick and extend laterally for 1-2 km. They are predominantly horizontally laminated and contain conglomeratic lenses made up of mudrock pebbles, pedogenic nodules and fragments of bone. These are interpreted as the in-channel deposits of ephemeral, low sinuosity rivers flowing in a general northerly direction across a semi-arid, low gradient alluvial plain."" \r\n",siltstone,"massive,paleosol/pedogenic,nodular,brown,red",,,Y,sandstone,planar lamination,dry floodplain,,macrofossils,body,good,,taxonomic,"mechanical,field collection",,,,,R.

Individual bones scattered within sandstone units, typically on scour surfaces, are the most common and show signs of having been reworked and transported. Complete to partial skeletons are typically found in mudstone directly above avulsion surfaces. Corpses were apparently stranded on avulsion surfaces and were soon buried during a subsequent flood from another channel (e.g., Smith, 1993). Specimens that were quickly buried are better preserved and less scattered (Fig. 8). We did not find evidence of scavenging, even though predators (e.g., thecodonts) are part of the fauna.

Individual bones scattered within sandstone units, typically on scour surfaces, are the most common and show signs of having been reworked and transported. Complete to partial skeletons are typically found in mudstone directly above avulsion surfaces. Corpses were apparently stranded on avulsion surfaces and were soon buried during a subsequent flood from another channel (e.g., Smith, 1993). Specimens that were quickly buried are better preserved and less scattered (Fig. 8). We did not find evidence of scavenging, even though predators (e.g., thecodonts) are part of the fauna.

Thin (<1 m) coarsening-upward sequences occur at intervals throughout the succession where the siltstone beds grade into greenish grey, lenticular-bedded, fine-grained sandstone (Fig. 1). These are in- terpreted as avulsion sequences similar to those described from the Eocene strata of the Bighorn Basin by Kraus (1996). They were deposited incrementally in the area between the meander- belt slope and the axial floodbasin as a complex of coalescing overbank splay sheets (Smith et al., 1989; Perez-Arlucea and Smith, 1999). Less than a meter above the burnetiid fossil, the sequence is truncated by the base of a crevasse-splay sandstone displaying climbing-ripple cross lamination grading upwards into massive siltstone. Sand from the crevasse channel has penetrated a set of desiccation cracks that are now preserved at its base, thus recording short-term exposure of the floodplain surface between episodic flood events. Evidence for an extended period of non- deposition on the floodplain surface is contained in the horizons of paleopedogenic calcareous nodules that occur throughout the succession (Fig. 1). Large (up to 30 cm long axis), smooth- surfaced micrite nodules are interpreted as palustrine carbonates that were precipitated within the surficial alluvium surrounding floodplain ponds and lakes (Sanz et al., 1995; Wright and Platt, 1995) under semi-arid climatic conditions. Horizons of smaller, more irregularly shaped micrite nodules resemble incipient pa- leocaliche formed in the B-horizons of soils that develop in well- drained, semi-arid floodplains (Goudie, 1983). This supports the highly seasonal rainfall and flooding regime interpreted from fluctuating river hydrology (Stear, 1978; Smith, 1987), seasonal growth rings in Araucarioxylon (Bamford, 1999), and desiccated floodplain paleosurfaces (Smith, 1993).",siltstone,"massive,lenticular,tabular",lithified,,Y,,,fine channel fill,,macrofossils,body,good,,taxonomic,"surface (in situ),mechanical,field collection",,,,,Roger M.H.

The bed from which the fossils come is a deep red shale, exposed on a series of hills over an area about an eighth of a mile on each side. This bed is capped in many places by a thin, dense siltstone. Overlying the siltstone is an orange-red shale that carries gypsum biscuits. Underlying the producing layer, which averages about four feet in thickness, is a brownish-red shale that is devoid\r\nof fossils. The most distinctive feature of the bone-bearing shale, outside of the fact that it has fossils, is the occurrence of two types of vertically oriented ovoid structures. One type consists of mottled red and green, hard nodules that range from one to four inches in maximum diameter and up to eighteen inches in length. They are rich in vertebrate remains. They appear to have formed around the bones after deposition, presumably as a result of the reducing action of organic materials. Their vertical orientation is somewhat\r\npuzzling. The contained vertebrate remains are usually oriented with their long axes vertical, and it seems quite certain that this position was attained after the formation of the nodules. Specimens of vertebrates free in the shale rather than in nodules are orientated with their long axes horizontal and have been subjected to considerable distortion and breakage. The most reasonable suggestion seems to be that the vertical orientation of the nodules was developed during compaction of the shales, which has been extensive, with the long axes shifting to become normal to the compacting forces.\r\nThe other vertical structures [...] have been termed pipes and have given the name to the site. They pass from the base to the top of the fossiliferous bed and, at the top, are continuous with the siltstone layer that caps the bed. Their composition is similar to the capping siltstone. The pipes are oval in cross section with maximum diameters from about four to twelve inches. Orientation of the long diameters is random, even in the 'clumps' in which the pipes tend to occur. These structures do not contain vertebrates, although specimens are found 'plastered' to their sides and occasionally penetrating the pipe for a short distance.\r\nThe origin of the pipes is by no means certain. It is thought that they were formed in open holes by the introduction of the sediment that formed the siltstone layer. Superficially, they resemble lungfish burrows of the Arroyo and Vale (Romer and Olson, 1954), but the shape, size, composition, weathering, and fossil content differ. The most probable explanation is that these openings were formed by the root-like shafts of some type of plant, possibly some\r\nEquisetales, that rotted to leave openings that were later filled by sediment.

This channel also has a basal conglomerate, but the majority of the bones, including semi-articulated and disarticulated skeletons, are in a reddish gray, blocky mudstone just above the basal conglomerate. The fossil-bearing layers associated with this small channel were measured at centimeter scale, and are found to include six minor sedimentary packages deposited near the confluence with the main channel.\r\nUnit 1: The lower most unit of the channel sequence consists of an approximately 22 cm thick limy conglomerate that rests atop a resistant, light gray limy sandstone that formed the base of the channel.\r\nThe conglomerate includes pebble-sized, intraformation rip-up clasts, fragments of bones and teeth, including sparse xenacanth shark teeth, and interspersed lenses of brownish gray siltstone;\r\nUnit 2: Overlying the conglomerate, there is an approximately 7.2 cm brownish gray silty mudrock with blocky weathering. The bed is devoid of fossils and thins gradually toward the eastern corner of the\r\nquarry;\r\nUnit 3: Overyling with sharp contact, this unit is a 6.4 cm thick, light gray, limy pebble conglomerate that is lithologically similar to the basal Unit 1. As in Unit 1, the conglomerate contains sparse xenacanth teeth\r\nand occasional isolated (disarticulated) tetrapod bones;\r\nUnit 4: The upper portion of the conglomerate in Unit 3 bears a sharp contact with a thin bed of reddish gray mudstone, the bonebed layer, which hosts the densest concentration of fossils, including partial\r\nskeletons. The unit is approximately 6.4 cm thick and, in addition to the vertebrate remains detailed below, contains sparse shells of microconchid invertebrates (up to ~3 mm diameter). Its uppermost contact\r\npreserves a paleosurface with extensive mudcracks. Sparse xenacanth teeth show little abrasion, suggesting limited transport or reworking, and are interspersed among semi-articulated and disarticulated tetrapod skeletons. Skeletal remains are densest in the northeastern portion of the quarry, with multiple stacked, disarticulated skeletons that include the large temnospondyl amphibian Eryops and the synapsids\r\nOphiacodon and Edaphosaurus, among other scattered tetrapod bones. A predominantly NW-SE trend of the bones is roughly tangential to the main trunk channel, indicating gentle but directional flow and arguing against the possibility that it is either a pond or crevasse splay deposit.\r\nUnit 5: Overlying the mudrock is a somewhat friable 5.7 cm thick fine-grained sandstone with a pebble lag. Portions of the sandstone may weather into plates or wedges that reveal plant compressions, primarily\r\nrusty woody debris with no discernable morphology;\r\nUnit 6: The sandstone of Unit 5 is overlain by more than 30 cm thickness of dull orange, massive, siltstone—probably redeposited loessite (Soreghan et al., 2002a, 2002b)—with centimeter-scale lenses of light gray, fine-grained sandstone.

Mudstones predominate and occur as dull reddish-brown (Munsell color ∼5YR 5/3), weakly- bedded to relict-laminated layers or as massive to blocky layers. These can occur with and without carbonate nodules and tubules and can range from a few centimeters to several meters thick. Many mudstone layers also include coarse silt to fine sand-filled desiccation cracks extending vertically into the mudstone and tapering downward as much as 10 centimeters. Sandstone beds occur as dull reddish-brown layers ranging from very-fine to fine-grained and range from <10 centimeters to slightly more than two-meters thick. Thinner beds of sandstone are typically ripple cross-laminated and commonly intercalated with thin mudstone beds (e.g., between 3.5 and 7 meters in Figure 1) or thin beds of carbonate-nodule conglomerates (e.g., between 35.5 and 39 meters, between 44 and 46 meters in Figure 1). Thicker beds and successions of sandstone exhibit general upward- fining textures with upward changes in sedimentary structures from planar bedding to trough-cross-bedding, into ripple-cross lamination (e.g., between 12 and 16 meters in Figure 1). Conglomerates occur only as thin beds of carbonate nodules similar morphologically to nodules found in the underlying blocky mudstone. They are typically clast-supported and have a fine muddy sandstone matrix. Relict-laminated muds tend to have the greatest concentrations of fossil vertebrate material and even preserve some large diameter burrows (∼30 cm wide), that are possibly vertebrate dwelling structures (e.g., between 20 and 22.5 meters in Figure 1).
